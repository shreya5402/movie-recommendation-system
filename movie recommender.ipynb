    "# Types of recommender systems:-\n",
    "# 1.content based -- on the basis of the content similarity it recommends the content. \n",
    "# Eg. if you're watching a rom com then similar rom coms will be recommended. \n",
    "# Tags are created for the products and on the basis of tags recoomendation is done\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.collaborative filter based -- On the basis of similar users interest. \n",
    "# For example if we have two users A and B. \n",
    "# According to their previous rating experineces we've found out that both of them have rated the same movies equally.\n",
    "# so if user A watches a movie xyz and rates is as good then the same movie will be recommended to user B \n",
    "# because of the similarity between interests of the two user. \n",

    "#movies is a dataframe that is created to read the database \n",

    "#To merge two dataframes:- \n",
    "#1. find some common ground to merge the dataframes. For example title, id, name of something etc.\n",
    "#2. To merge simply write:- dataframe1.merge(dataframe2,on='column-basis') e.g.- movies.merge(credits, on='Title')\n",
